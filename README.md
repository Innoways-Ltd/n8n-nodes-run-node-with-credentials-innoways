## Developer

Hi, 

My name is Bram and I am the developer of this node.
I am an independant consultant and expert partner of n8n.
My nodes are free to use for everyone, but please consider [donating](https://donate.stripe.com/3cs5oe7xM6L77Yc5ko) when you use my nodes.
This helps me to build and maintain nodes for everyone to use.

If you are looking for some outside help with n8n, I can of course also offer my services.
* Node Development
* Workflow Development
* Mentoring
* Support

Please contact me @ bram@knitco.nl if you want to make use of my services.

For questions or issues with nodes, please open an issue on Github.
